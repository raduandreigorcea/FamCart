// Sentry installs its own global handlers inside init(), which is deferred to
// idle so the SDK stays out of the initial download. That leaves a gap at cold
// start where an unhandled rejection reaches nothing at all — the boot window,
// where the router guard, the Clerk load and the first fetches live.
//
// captureEarlyErrors() stands in for that window. The half worth pinning is the
// handover: these listeners must come off once the SDK is live, or every error
// gets reported twice, and a duplicate is the kind of regression nobody notices
// until they are reading the same stack trace in two issues.
