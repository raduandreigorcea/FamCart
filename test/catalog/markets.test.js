// The catalog and the app have to agree on which markets exist, and there is no
// runtime that would ever tell you they had stopped agreeing.
//
// THIS TEST READS ACROSS A REPOSITORY BOUNDARY ON PURPOSE, and it is the only
// one here that does. The catalog is a submodule (catalog/, published as
// raduandreigorcea/FamCart-catalog) with its own tests, and everything that
// concerns only the catalog lives over there. This one cannot: it compares the
// catalog's market list against src/lib/region.ts, and neither repo can see
// both sides on its own.
//
// It therefore FAILS LOUDLY on a checkout with no submodules, which is why
// .github/workflows/ci.yml passes `submodules: true` on the unit-test job.
//
// WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT IT, and note that the second one CHANGED with the
// catalog rebuild:
//
//   * region.ts gains a market the catalog's check constraint rejects → every
//     retailer registered for it is refused at import, so the market stays
//     permanently empty and the failure shows up as an empty dropdown in one
//     country.
//   * region.ts gains a market no retailer sells in → p_markets carries a code
//     that matches no row. This used to mean every product was DEMOTED for that
//     phone and the dropdown filled with foreign names. Since the rebuild
//     p_markets FILTERS, so it now means that phone gets nothing from the
//     catalog at all. That is the correct answer for a country we have no shops
//     in, and it is still worth knowing which countries those are.
//
// (Two assertions were dropped here rather than updated. They pinned the
// catalog's six-language list against src/locales/, back when a catalog product
// carried a name per language and search ranked on it. Products now come from
// Romanian retailers in Romanian, search_catalog accepts p_langs and ignores it,
// and there is no language vocabulary left to drift.)
