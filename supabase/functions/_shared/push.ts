// The decisions behind the push fan-out, separated from the runtime that
// delivers it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// push-on-item-insert/index.ts is deployed code that nothing in this repo could
// check. tsconfig.json includes only `src/**`, so vue-tsc never sees it; eslint
// reads it but typescript-eslint turns off no-undef, so `Deno.env` and the
// `npm:` specifier pass without ever being resolved; and it could not be
// unit-tested, because importing it runs `Deno.serve` and `createClient` at
// module scope. So the one piece of the product that decides what every
// notification SAYS had no coverage of any kind.
//
// Splitting it is the same move the catalog repo already makes with
// catalog/supabase/functions/_shared, and it is a deployment constraint rather
// than taste: a Supabase edge function may only import files inside
// supabase/functions, because that is the directory the CLI uploads. `_shared`
// is Supabase's own convention for the part that several places need.
//
// So: no Deno APIs, no Node built-ins, no npm imports. Everything here is
// standard and runs unchanged under Deno, under Node and under vitest. Deno
// resolves imports by full path, which is why index.ts asks for `push.ts` with
// its extension.

/**
 * The six languages the app speaks, and the copy each of them gets.
 *
 * WHY THIS TABLE IS HERE AND NOT IN src/locales.
 *
 * A Supabase edge function may only import files under supabase/functions —
 * that is the directory the CLI uploads — so it cannot read the app's own
 * catalogs even though they hold the same six languages. The duplication is a
 * deployment constraint, not a choice, and it is small and self-contained for
 * that reason: three sentences per language and no interpolation the app's
 * `t()` would do better.
 *
 * `en` is the fallback and must stay complete: OneSignal falls back to it for
 * any subscriber whose language is not a key here.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS OFTEN ONE, which is the trap in the counted branch. It is
 * `labels.length - 2`, so a three-item checkout — much the commonest kind —
 * spells it "and 1 more". English and Spanish read the same either way; German,
 * French and Italian do not, and "et 1 autres" is the kind of wrong that makes
 * an app look machine-translated. So `andMore` branches on the count in the
 * three languages that need it, and Intl.PluralRules is deliberately not
 * reached for: two forms over a number that is always a positive integer is
 * what a ternary is for, and the plural machinery belongs in lib/i18n where
 * there are hundreds of strings to justify it.
 *
 * Two known cosmetic limits, named so they are not mistaken for oversights.
 * Spanish turns "y" into "e" before a word starting with i- or hi-, and Italian
 * turns "e" into "ed" before a vowel; both depend on the next word, which here
 * is an arbitrary product name. Getting them right means a phonetic rule over
 * user data for one conjunction on a lock screen, which is not worth the code.
