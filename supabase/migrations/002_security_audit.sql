-- ─── security audit trail and rate limiting ──────────────────────────────────
-- Two locked-down tables and the functions that write them: what happened, how
-- often someone is allowed to make it happen, and who may read that back.
--
-- This comes before the list, families and the catalog because all three depend
-- on it — join_family_with_code() logs here and throttles against it, the list's
-- insert trigger (004_shopping_list.sql) throttles against it, and so do the two
-- catalog write RPCs.
--
-- Why any of this lives in the database rather than at the edge: the browser
-- talks to Supabase directly (VITE_SUPABASE_URL), so a Vercel firewall rule only
-- ever sees requests for the app shell, never a single PostgREST call. Anything
-- that watches or throttles the API has to live where the API does. Sentry has
-- the same blind spot — it only sees the browser, and someone hitting PostgREST
-- with a valid token never loads our JavaScript.

-- ─── reading the trail back ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- security_events records the right things, but nothing surfaces them, so in
-- practice it only gets read if someone goes looking. This is as much of that gap
-- as the architecture closes.
--
-- What is deliberately NOT built here: a push alert from inside the database.
--
-- An earlier version of this note justified that by saying pg_net is not
-- installed. That was simply wrong — pg_net is installed, and the push webhooks
-- in 007_realtime.sql run on it. The real reason is narrower and worth stating
-- honestly: an alert channel needs somewhere to send to, and the surface that was
-- removed as an SSRF and exfiltration risk was an *owner-configurable* URL. A
-- hardcoded alert endpoint would not reopen that hole, but it would mean a
-- credential and a destination living in the schema, and an alerting path that
-- fails silently inside a trigger nobody watches. An external poller that fails
-- loudly is the better shape, which is what the role at the bottom of this file
-- and .github/workflows/security-digest.yml provide.
--
-- The remaining honest options are:
--   • this: one query, run from the Supabase SQL editor when you want to look;
--   • an external poller holding a database credential. That is real alerting,
--     but it puts a credential somewhere new, which is a trade worth making
--     deliberately rather than by default.
--
-- Both are now in use. The digest below is the manual read; the poller is
-- .github/workflows/security-digest.yml, running daily as the narrow role
-- defined at the bottom of this file.
--
-- Usage, in the Supabase SQL editor:
--   select * from public.security_digest();     -- last 7 days
--   select * from public.security_digest(30);   -- last 30 days
--
-- Read it as: anything with a nonzero rate_limited or invite_rate_limited count
-- is someone hitting a ceiling, and distinct_actors tells you whether it is one
-- account or many.

--
-- WHY NOT `grant select on security_events`
--
-- Because it does not work, though it looks like it should. This table has RLS
-- enabled with zero policies, and RLS applies to every role except the table's
-- owner — so a plain SELECT grant passes the privilege check and then matches no
-- rows. That is a poller reporting "all quiet" forever, which is worse than no
-- poller at all. security_digest() is SECURITY DEFINER, so it runs as the owner
-- and can see the table; EXECUTE on it is the only grant that reads anything,
-- and it hands back aggregates rather than the rows themselves.
--
-- So the role gets connect, usage on the schema, and execute on one function. It
-- holds no SELECT on any table in this database, including the one it reports
-- on, and cannot write at all. Raw-row triage stays where it was: the SQL
-- editor, as the service role.
