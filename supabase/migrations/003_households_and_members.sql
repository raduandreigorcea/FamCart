-- ─── households, members, and profiles ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- Who exists, who belongs to what, and who is allowed to change it.
--
-- Three tables, in dependency order: profiles (identity), households (the group),
-- household_members (the join, which references both).
--
-- The permission model in one paragraph: a household has exactly one owner, the
-- account in households.created_by, and it can never be reassigned. The owner may
-- rename the household, delete it, and grant or revoke the moderator rank.
-- Moderators may change operational settings and remove plain members. Everyone
-- else may read the roster and remove only themselves. Policies decide who may
-- touch a row; triggers decide which columns of it, because a policy cannot see
-- the difference between renaming a household and changing its owner.

-- ─── profiles ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- One source of truth for member identity.
--
-- A user's Clerk display name and avatar is stored once, here, keyed by Clerk
-- user id. household_members and the active shopping list carry only the user id
-- and resolve name/avatar by joining this table, so a profile edit shows up
-- everywhere at once.
--
-- purchase_history (005) deliberately does NOT do this: it keeps its own
-- added_by_name / added_by_image_url columns, because history is an archive and
-- is meant to freeze who added an item and how they looked at the time. That is
-- a snapshot, not redundancy.

  -- which is what this check allowed for a while: every co-member's browser
  -- fetches whatever is here, handing the person who chose it their IP, device
  -- and viewing time. Clerk serves every avatar from img.clerk.com whatever the
  -- original source, so nothing legitimate is excluded. The client mirrors this

-- ─── bounds that have to be restated ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- Everything inside `create table if not exists` above applies only when the
-- table is created. On a database where households already exists — which is every
-- database this file has run against more than once — that whole block is
-- skipped, so changing a bound here never reaches it.
--
-- That is not hypothetical. Production allowed 40-character household names while
-- this file said 25, and re-running the file could not converge it: the server
-- was quietly more permissive than both this schema and the client, which caps
-- the form at HOUSEHOLD_NAME_MAX_LENGTH (src/lib/limits.ts). A hand-crafted request
-- could set a name longer than anything the UI is built to show.
--
-- Restating the bound as an explicit ALTER is what makes re-running this file
-- actually converge it. Only this constraint is restated, because only this one
-- has drifted — but any bound in the block above needs the same treatment the
-- day it changes, or it will silently apply to new databases only.

-- Creation used to be three client writes — upsert the profile (the FK target),
-- insert the household, insert the membership — with a compensating DELETE if
-- the third failed. That compensation is itself a network call, and when it
-- failed the result was unrecoverable by the user:
--
--   • households_one_per_owner is a unique index on created_by, so the orphan
--     permanently occupies the account's one ownership slot;
--   • every household list in the app is derived from household_members, so the
--     orphan appears nowhere the user could leave or delete it;
--   • the setup screen's own ownership probe reads households by created_by, so
--     it finds the orphan and correctly hides the create option — telling the
--     user they already own a household they cannot see.
--
-- A function body is one transaction, so the membership limit trigger raising
-- now rolls the household insert back with it. There is no window to compensate
-- for, which is a different thing from a smaller one.
--
-- The invite code still comes from the client (src/lib/inviteCode.ts mints it
-- with a CSPRNG) rather than being generated here, so this change is only about
-- atomicity. The format is re-checked below anyway: households_invite_code_format_check
-- would catch a malformed one, but as a constraint violation rather than as the
-- named error the caller can act on.

-- membership all happen in one server-side step; the direct INSERT policy above
-- covers only the creator-seeding case, so there is no client path that joins a
-- household without presenting a valid code.
--
-- Throttling, honestly scoped: the limit is per Clerk user, because PostgREST
-- does not hand the database a client IP. Someone willing to mint many Clerk
-- accounts can still spread attempts across them — Clerk's own signup rate
-- limiting is what covers that, and a 32^8 (~1.1 trillion) code space is what
-- makes the exercise pointless. The goal here is a ceiling plus a trail, not an
-- impregnable gate.
--
-- Note what does NOT exist: any function that merely resolves a code to a household
-- without joining. Such a lookup is a free yes/no oracle — exactly the primitive
-- a brute-forcer wants, and cheaper to call than this. Every invite-code check
-- goes through this throttled, audited path.

-- Hosted Supabase hands anon, authenticated and service_role broad table
-- privileges when a project is provisioned. Every file here only ever ADDS
-- grants, so those defaults survived untouched: production had DELETE on
-- profiles for authenticated, and full read/write for anon, on tables these
-- files describe as tightly scoped. RLS blocked all of it, which is why nothing
-- was ever wrong — but it meant the second gate this schema keeps talking about
-- was open the whole time, and the files were describing an intent rather than a
-- state.
--
-- Closing it, once, for the three roles:
--
--   anon          — nothing at all. Every policy here resolves through
--                   requesting_user_id(), which is null without a JWT, so an
--                   anonymous caller could already read nothing. The difference
--                   is that it now gets a permission error instead of an empty
--                   result, which is the honest answer: an unauthenticated read
--                   is a bug, not an empty shopping list.
--   authenticated — exactly what the grants above name, nothing more.
--   service_role  — reads everything (it is the ops and triage identity, and
--                   the push function reads household_members and profiles with
--                   it), but writes only where a script genuinely writes:
--                   product_catalog, in 006.
--
-- WHY THIS REVOKES ALL AND RE-GRANTS RATHER THAN SUBTRACTING
--
-- `revoke insert, update, delete` looks like enough and is not. The provisioning
-- default also includes TRUNCATE, and TRUNCATE is not subject to row level
-- security — a role holding it empties the table whatever the policies say. It
-- is not reachable through PostgREST, which speaks CRUD and not raw SQL, and
-- `authenticated` cannot log in directly, so nothing could actually use it. But
-- "unreachable today" is a weak thing to rest a table's contents on when the
-- alternative is one word. REFERENCES and TRIGGER came along for the same ride.
--
-- 004, 005 and 006 do the same for their own tables.
