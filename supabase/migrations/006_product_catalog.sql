-- ─── product catalog ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The products offered while typing in the add-item box, and the throttled ways
-- the catalog grows.
--
-- Scope lives in one column:
--   household_id is null  - global. Written by catalog-importer with the service
--                        role key, and suggested to everyone. A few hundred
--                        'curated' rows predate it, from a seed script deleted
--                        in 9a4366e -- they are still in production and nothing
--                        in the repo regenerates them, which is why the import
--                        is careful never to overwrite one (guarantee 2 below).
--   household_id = <uuid> - contributed via add_custom_product(), suggested only
--                        back to that household until enough OTHER households add the
--                        same product, at which point it is promoted to global.
--
-- That promotion rule is what makes a user-writable catalog safe. A misspelling
-- one household types stays scoped to them forever; a product several households
-- independently ask for earns its way in on its own. No moderation queue, and no
-- way for one household's spelling to leak into everyone else's suggestions — the
-- threshold counts distinct contributing *accounts* (contributed_by) AND the
-- distinct households they contributed from, and both must reach it. Crossing it
-- takes three separate people who each added the product in their own household.
-- One account belonging to three households and typing the same junk into all
-- three counts as one account and cannot self-promote; three accounts one person
-- controls inside a single household count as one household and cannot either.
--
-- Clients never write this table. RLS grants SELECT and nothing else; the two
-- SECURITY DEFINER RPCs at the bottom are the only writes reachable from the
-- app, and both are rate-limited (002_security_audit.sql).
--
-- Ranking is the sum of two columns, kept apart so re-seeding never wipes earned
-- usage:
--   base_weight - editorial cold-start baseline. The importer overwrites it
--                 freely on every run for rows it owns.
--   add_count   - times the product was actually added. Only the RPCs touch it.
-- popularity is their stored sum, and suggestions order by it descending.

-- ─── bulk import ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Load a batch of externally-sourced products into the global catalog.
--
-- WHY THIS IS AN RPC AND NOT supabase-js .upsert()
--
-- PostgREST can only infer ON CONFLICT against a *total* unique constraint. Of
-- the three keys that govern a global row, only
-- product_catalog_name_maker_household_unique qualifies —
-- product_catalog_global_search and product_catalog_global_barcode are both
-- partial indexes, and `.upsert({ onConflict: 'barcode' })` against either fails
-- at runtime with "there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON
-- CONFLICT specification". If a later change ever "simplifies" this back to a
-- client-side upsert, that is the error it will produce.
--
-- WHAT IT GUARANTEES
--
-- 1. search_text is computed here, by product_search_text(). The database stays
--    the sole authority on the matching key, so the importer's own copy of the
--    normalizer can only affect its client-side collapsing and can never
--    disagree with the unique index.
-- 2. An import may never change the name, maker, base_weight, or source of a row
--    whose source is not this import's source. Curated wins, always. A curated
--    row gets the upstream barcode filled in for free and keeps everything else.
-- 3. add_count is never written, with exactly one exception — the final step,
--    which folds already-earned counts off scoped rows the import supersedes.
--    Earned usage survives every re-import.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER, so the body always runs as this function's owner whatever
-- role called it. Two concrete failures forced that, both invisible to a test
-- suite running as superuser because superusers bypass privilege checks:
--   1. As INVOKER the body ran as service_role, which has no EXECUTE on
--      product_search_text, so every real import died with "permission denied".
--   2. The staging table is created by whoever calls, so a second call from a
--      different role in the same session cannot drop the first one's table.
