-- ─── purchase history ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- What was bought, and the single path that records it.
--
-- Checking an item marks it as ready to buy; checking out archives every checked
-- item here and removes it from the active list. The archive is what
-- distinguishes buying from the trash button (delete = "I don't want this"), so
-- it is driven by an explicit RPC rather than a delete trigger — a trigger could
-- not tell a purchase apart from a merge-delete or an individual removal, and
-- would fill history with things nobody bought.
--
-- buy_items() is the ONLY writer. The client has select and nothing else, which
-- is deliberate and load-bearing: a direct insert path would let any member forge
-- author names and avatars, and post-date purchased_at to trick the retention
-- logic below into deleting a family's real checkouts.

-- left join, so an item added by someone who has since left the family still
-- archives with a 'Member' fallback rather than losing the row.
