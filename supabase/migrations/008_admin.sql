-- ─── the admin read surface ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Who is allowed to see across households, and the functions that let them.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--
-- Every table in this schema is scoped by household membership, and
-- security_events is scoped to nobody at all (RLS on, zero policies). That is
-- the correct posture for an app where the only reader is a member, and it means
-- there is no query a client can issue that answers "how many households are
-- there". The FamCart-admin dashboard needs exactly those answers.
--
-- Three ways to give it them, and only the third is acceptable:
--
--   1. Put the service-role key in the dashboard. It is a browser app on a
--      public repo. No.
--   2. Stand up a server that holds the service-role key and proxies. A whole
--      deployment target, its own secrets and its own outage mode, for what is
--      fundamentally a set of SELECTs.
--   3. Let Postgres decide. SECURITY DEFINER functions that check an admin table
--      before they read anything. The dashboard keeps using the ordinary
--      publishable key and an ordinary Clerk token, and the database is the
--      authority on who gets more than their own household.
--
-- So: this file adds one table, one gate, and a set of read functions. The
-- dashboard owns none of it, exactly as this app owns none of search_catalog()
-- over in the catalog project.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately: any function that deletes a household, removes
-- a member, or edits a product. The dashboard is a read surface plus the two
-- grant/revoke writes at the foot of this file. Adding a destructive RPC here is
-- a decision to take on its own, with its own audit entry and its own test.
--
-- Re-runnable like every other file in this directory. Note the trap the others
-- document: a constraint declared inside `create table if not exists` is skipped
-- wherever the table already exists, so any bound changed up there has to be
-- restated as an explicit alter below it.

-- ─── who is an admin ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- A table rather than a JWT claim. A claim would mean editing Clerk's Supabase
-- token template in a dashboard, which is a place this repo cannot see and
-- CLAUDE.md already lists two ways to get wrong; a table is checked where the
-- data is, in the same transaction as the read it is gating.
create table if not exists public.admin_users (
  user_id    text        primary key,   -- Clerk user id
  -- Free text, for the human reason. "Owner", "on-call for the August import".
  note       text,
  granted_by text,                      -- Clerk user id of the granting admin; null for the bootstrap row
  granted_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  constraint admin_users_note_length
    check (note is null or char_length(note) between 1 and 200)
);

comment on table public.admin_users is
  'Clerk user ids allowed to call the admin_* functions. Written by admin_grant/'
  'admin_revoke, or by hand with the service role to seed the first row. '
  'Unreadable by client roles: is_admin() is how a client asks about itself.';

-- The same closed-door treatment security_events gets, and for the same reason.
-- RLS on with zero policies means no client role can select, insert, update or
-- delete: every row fails the policy check that does not exist. So the list of
-- who can see everything is itself not visible to anyone holding a token.
alter table public.admin_users enable row level security;

-- Grants and RLS are separate gates, and hosted Supabase hands the API roles
-- table privileges at provisioning. Revoke explicitly rather than trusting RLS
-- alone; this closes both.
revoke all on public.admin_users from anon, authenticated;

-- ─── dropped before they are created ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- `create or replace function` CANNOT change a function's return type, and for a
-- `returns table (...)` function the OUT parameters ARE the return type. Change
-- one column of one of the tables below and re-running this file fails with
--
--   cannot change return type of existing function (SQLSTATE 42P13)
--   Row type defined by OUT parameters is different.
--
-- on every database that already has the old shape -- which is every database
-- except a fresh one. So a local `db reset` passes, CI passes, and the push to a
-- real project is the thing that fails.
--
-- That is the same class of trap the other files in this directory document for
-- constraints declared inside `create table if not exists`: the re-runnable
-- version works everywhere except where it matters. The fix is the same shape
-- too -- state it explicitly rather than relying on the idempotent form.
--
-- Dropping first is safe here because this file recreates every one of them a
-- few lines below, and because plpgsql function bodies are not dependency-tracked:
-- dropping is_admin() does not invalidate the functions that call it, and they
-- all resolve again once it is back.
--
-- ANY function added below needs its signature added here, with its argument
-- types, or it will be the one that fails on the next shape change.

-- ─── the gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The one question a client may ask about this table, and it may only ask it
-- about itself: `select public.is_admin()`. The dashboard calls this on boot to
-- decide whether to render an admin shell or a "not authorised" screen.
--
-- Answering it honestly to a non-admin costs nothing. It reveals that an admin
-- system exists, which the public repo already does, and it does not reveal who
-- the admins are or how many there are.

-- ─── per-user facts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- One definition of "what do we know about this account", shared by the overview,
-- the user list and the user detail page, so the three can never disagree about
-- what "active" means.
--
-- TWO COLUMNS HERE ARE DERIVED RATHER THAN RECORDED, and the dashboard labels
-- them as such:
--
--   first_seen  - nothing records a signup. profiles has updated_at and no
--                 created_at, and a profile row is written on first sign-in and
--                 rewritten on every edit. The earliest membership join is the
--                 better witness, so this is the earlier of that and the profile
--                 timestamp. For a user who has never joined a household and
--                 never edited their name, it is exactly the signup time; for
--                 one who renamed themselves last week it is still their first
--                 join.
--
--   last_active - nothing records a session either. There is no login table, so
--                 this is the most recent thing the account is known to have
--                 DONE: added an item, checked out, joined a household, or
--                 changed their profile. A user who opened the app every day and
--                 added nothing reads as inactive here, which is the honest
--                 answer to the question this column can actually answer.
--
-- Anything that wants a true signup or session number has to record one first.

-- ─── writing to them ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHY THERE ARE RPCs HERE AT ALL
--
-- product_catalog has exactly one RLS policy and it is a SELECT. There is no
-- insert, update or delete policy, deliberately: every write in 006 goes through
-- a `security definer` function that owns a rule -- add_custom_product() counts a
-- household's contributions against a ceiling, promote_product_from_scoped()
-- waits for three distinct accounts in three distinct households. A dashboard
-- cannot write this table directly and should not be able to.
--
-- It also could not compute what it would need to write. search_text is derived
-- by product_search_text(), whose EXECUTE is revoked from `authenticated` on
-- purpose (006 line 261): a client that can compute the merge key can craft a
-- name that collides with an existing product. So the derivation has to happen
-- on this side of the boundary regardless.
--
-- WHAT AN ADMIN MAY NOT DO, AND WHY
--
-- add_count is never writable here. It is earned usage -- the count of real adds
-- by real households -- and it is half of the generated `popularity` column. An
-- admin who could set it could manufacture the appearance of demand, and the
-- promotion gate in 006 reads the same signal. base_weight is the editorial
-- thumb on the scale and is the correct knob; it is what the seed uses and what
-- these functions expose.
--
-- Nor may an admin create a household-scoped row. Scoped rows record that a
-- specific household asked for something, and one invented from this dashboard
-- would be a contribution nobody made, counting toward a promotion nobody
-- requested. Admin-created rows are global and curated, which is what they are.
--
-- DELETING IS SAFE, WHICH IS WORTH STATING
--
-- Nothing in this schema has a foreign key to product_catalog, and
-- shopping_list_items store `name` and `maker` as plain text (004). Removing a
-- product therefore removes a SUGGESTION and never touches anybody's list. That
-- is why this is an ordinary delete rather than another soft-delete column.
