// The dialog shell: overlay, dismissal, scroll lock, and focus. Knows nothing
// about what is in it.
//
// Same idea as PopoverMenu, which already owns those concerns for menus. Six
// dialogs had grown their own overlay independently and drifted apart: only
// AccountActionModal closed on Escape, none of them locked the page behind
// them, and only CustomProductModal put focus anywhere. Behaviour every dialog
// should share is the kind that belongs in one place.
//
// Two things it deliberately does NOT do:
//
//   • Teleport, unlike PopoverMenu. The menus are teleported because their
//     callers sit inside containers that clip or stack; the dialogs render at
//     view root already, so teleporting would only move their DOM out of the
//     component tree their tests and scoped CSS reach.
//
//   • Own the ARIA. role, aria-modal and aria-labelledby stay on the caller's
//     own dialog element. Wrapping that in a second labelled element would
//     announce the dialog twice, and the obvious way to avoid a visual wrapper
//     — display:contents — is known to drop elements out of the accessibility
//     tree in several browsers, which is the opposite of the point.
//
// The overlay class and transition name come from the caller so each dialog
// keeps the look it already had: parent scoped styles apply to a child
// component's root element, and the overlay below is this component's root.

  // may not want to be dismissed by accident.
  closeOnBackdrop: { type: Boolean, default: true },
  // Opening a dialog does not focus anything in it. It used to focus the first
  // focusable element, which is a reasonable default only if that element was
  // chosen — and it never was: it is whatever comes first in the markup, which
  // in most of these dialogs is the close button. So dialogs opened looking like
  // the way out was the thing to press, and Enter dismissed them.
  //
  // On for a dialog that genuinely has a first thing to do; CustomProductModal
  // does its own instead, because it wants the field selected as well as
  // focused. Escape, the Tab trap and restoring focus on close are unaffected —
  // the trap already pulls focus in from outside on the first Tab, so the
  // keyboard still cannot walk into the page behind.

  <!-- `appear` is what makes a dialog animate the FIRST time it opens.
       The heavy dialogs are lazy: the topbar renders them under a
       `v-if="everOpened"` that flips true in the same tick as `open`, so on the
       first open this component mounts with `open` already true and the overlay
       is present on the Transition's initial render — which Vue does not
       animate unless asked. Every later open toggles `open` on a component that
       is already mounted, which is why only the first one was missing its
       animation. Dialogs that are always mounted (AccountActionModal) never hit
       this, and `appear` is inert for them: their initial render has no
       element to animate. -->
