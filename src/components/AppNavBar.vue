/* ─── How the bar answers a press ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   Every control up here summons something — a panel, a sheet, a dialog — so they
   all give way the same way: recede under the finger while the thing they called
   for comes forward. Same direction as the empty state's chips, which press in
   "rather than lifting" for the same reason.

   Two things about it are load-bearing, and both were what made this bar feel
   like it lagged behind the finger:

   1. The press is NOT transitioned. Easing INTO a pressed state is the classic
      way to build a button that feels slow — the finger is down and the pixels
      are still on their way. In instantly, out over --transition-fast.
   2. It has to be visible. The two controls that had an :active state painted
      --border-light, which in light mode is the same #f3f4f6 as --bg-hover and
      in dark is lighter than it, so a press either changed nothing or moved the
      wrong way. The other two had no :active at all — and the list block,
      the biggest target in the bar, also suppresses the tap highlight, so a tap
      on it changed nothing on screen at all until its dialog arrived. --bg-press is a real step in the right direction in both
      themes.

   Scale is inverse to size: the same ratio that reads as a press on a 40px
   circle reads as a lurch on a block the width of the screen. */
