// where a row came from is the one thing you cannot tell by looking at it: a
// product scraped from Auchan and one somebody in the household typed in render
// identically. A shopper never sees this.
//
// A LOGO RATHER THAN THE NAME, because the shop and the maker are frequently the
// same word -- Auchan sells products branded Auchan -- and "Auchan Auchan" reads
// as a rendering bug. A mark next to text cannot be misread as more text.
//

// The two callers size them differently through their own scoped CSS, which is
// the convention every other icon here already follows.

// A shop with no logo file renders an empty disc rather than a broken image:
// AppIcon yields '' for a name it does not have. That is the right failure for a
// fourth retailer added to the registry before somebody draws its mark.
// The names live in lib/shopBadges beside the shop list, because the filters
// label the same shops these discs do and two copies would drift.

// Lidl's is a roundel and its asset is LIDL'S OWN FAVICON, taken from
// lidl.ro rather than from an icon set. That matters: the icon-set version is
// flattened to one blue, which throws away the yellow and red that make the mark
// recognisable, and what was left was a faint ring with four unreadable letters
// in it. Their favicon is the mark they themselves ship for a 16-pixel browser
// tab, so it is drawn to survive being tiny -- the colour does the work and the
// lettering is a detail rather than the whole thing.
//
// Auchan's bird and Carrefour's C are single-colour glyphs with no background of
// their own and keep the inset, or they would touch the rim.
