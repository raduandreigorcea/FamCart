import { computed } from 'vue'

// Every icon in the app, through one component.
//
// ─── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not to save the imports. It is so that `vue/no-v-html` can be ON.
//
// There were 58 v-html bindings across 15 files, each with its own `?raw`
// import, and the lint rule was disabled globally to keep them quiet. The
// argument for that was sound as far as it went -- all 58 were build-time SVGs
// from this repository, and 58 false warnings train the eye to skip lint output
// -- but it named the exact thing that would make it wrong (binding v-html to a
// product name, a display name, a household name) and then removed the only
// mechanism that would catch it. Those three values are what this app renders on
// every screen.
//
// One audited site is the way out. The rule is on everywhere else now, so a
// v-html on anything reaching a component from outside the bundle is a build
// failure rather than something a reviewer has to notice.
//
// ─── WHY v-html AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The alternative is <img>, which cannot inherit currentColor, so every icon
// would need a hardcoded colour and none of them would follow the theme.
//
// Safe by construction, and narrowly so: `markup` can only be a value from the
// eager glob below, which is to say a .svg file in this repository resolved at
// build time. An unknown name yields '' and renders nothing. No user data, no
// database value and no network response can reach it. The disable is around the
// one element rather than in eslint.config.js, so a genuine misuse anywhere else
// still fails the build.
//
// ─── WHY IT CARRIES NO STYLES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Deliberate, and the reason this differs from the dashboard's AppIcon, which
// owns its own sizing.
//
// This app already had a convention before this component existed: the wrapper
// span is sized by the calling component's scoped CSS, and 41 `:deep(svg)` rules
// set width/height/stroke per site, because the same glyph is a 14px tick in a
// suggestion row and a 40px mark in a dialog header. Shipping any box model here
// would fight all of them.
//
// So this renders the same span those rules were written against, and the
// caller's class lands on it: `.confirm-dialog__icon :deep(svg)` still matches,
// because a child component's root element carries the parent's scope id. The
// swap is therefore invisible in the rendered CSS, which is what made migrating
// 58 sites at once a reasonable thing to do.

// eager: the whole set is a few KB of markup, and almost every one of these
// files was already statically imported before this component existed.
// Lazy-loading them would mean a request per icon and a frame of empty boxes on
// first paint.
//
// It does cost 1.6 KB against the 57 imports it replaces, which is worth writing
// down rather than discovering later. Five assets are used ONLY as CSS masks --
// add, package-search, moon, sun-medium, sun-moon -- so they were bundled as
// URLs and are now bundled as raw strings as well. Excluding them would mean a
// hardcoded list here that silently rots the first time one of them is used as
// an icon, which is a worse trade than 0.13% of the JavaScript.
//
// `**` rather than `*`: flags/ and brands/ are subdirectories, and their names
// carry the prefix (`flags/ro`, `brands/google`).
const FILES = import.meta.glob('../assets/**/*.svg', {
  query: '?raw',
  import: 'default',
  eager: true,
}) as Record<string, string>

const ICONS: Record<string, string> = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(FILES).map(([path, markup]) => [
    path.replace('../assets/', '').replace('.svg', ''),
    markup,
  ]),

   * from screen readers by default. Pass a label for the few that carry meaning
   * on their own.

// '' for an unknown or empty name, which is a real state rather than a mistake:
// several sites bind conditionally and mean "draw nothing here".
