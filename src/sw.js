// The barcode decoder, kept after the first scan rather than shipped to
// everyone up front.
//
// zxing_reader.wasm is ~1MB and is fetched only by browsers with no native
// BarcodeDetector — which is Safari (so every iPhone), Firefox, and Chrome on
// Windows, but not Chrome on Android and not the APK, where scanning goes
// through ML Kit and this file is never requested at all. It is deliberately
// absent from the precache globPatterns for that reason: adding `wasm` there
// would roughly double a 1MB precache for every visitor, including the ones
// who can never need it, which is the opposite of what the dynamic import in
// lib/barcodeScanner.ts is arranged to avoid.
//
// CacheFirst rather than a network strategy because the file is immutable —
// Vite fingerprints it, so a given URL is one exact build of one pinned
// zxing-wasm version and can never need revalidating. The cost is that the
// FIRST scan on such a browser still needs a connection; every scan after it
// works with no network, which is the case this app is actually built for.
//
// maxEntries: 1 is what keeps that honest across deploys. The name carries a
// content hash, so a version bump asks for a new URL and would otherwise leave
// the previous megabyte cached forever with nothing able to reach it; the
// expiration plugin evicts the old entry when the new one lands. Precached
// assets get this for free from cleanupOutdatedCaches, which is exactly what a
// hand-rolled runtime cache has to supply for itself.
