// Telling the Android app that a newer build exists, and installing it.
//
// The web app updates itself — a deploy lands, the service worker picks it up
// and lib/appUpdate.ts reloads the page (see the note there). The APK cannot do
// any of that. Its web assets are baked into the package, so the only way to a
// newer version is a new APK, and until now the only way to a new APK was to
// know that releases exist, open GitHub on a phone, and find the download.
//
// WHERE "NEWEST" COMES FROM
//
// The Android APK workflow publishes every master build to one rolling release
// tagged `latest`, whose *name* carries the version ("FamCart v0.1.23") and
// whose asset is FamCart.apk. That release is therefore the only honest answer
// to "is there a newer app": it exists exactly when a downloadable APK exists.
//
// Deliberately NOT the version deployed to the web app, which is the other thing
// we could have asked. The web deploy and the APK build are triggered by the
// same push but are not the same job — a web deploy that succeeds while the APK
// build fails would advertise a version with no APK behind it, and the update
// button would 404.
//
// api.github.com answers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so the WebView
// can make this call directly with no proxy of our own in between. The APK
// download itself is done natively (see AppInstallerPlugin.java) where CORS does
// not apply at all.

// famcart-last-user, famcart-offline-queue, famcart-household-snapshot). These
