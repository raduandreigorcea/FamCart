// `storage` handed in, the same shape as lib/theme — which is what lets the
// boot path, the settings dialog and the setup step all agree on one key
// without any of them owning the state. lib/i18n owns the reactive half and
// imports from here; nothing goes the other way.
//
// TWO keys, where theme needed one, and the reason is boot ordering. Theme is
// a property of the device, so it is readable before anyone signs in. A
// language is a property of the person — but AppSplash and LoginView both
// render before Clerk has resolved, and there is no user id to scope by yet.
// So the scoped key is the truth and the device key is a hint about what to
// show until the truth arrives, which is exactly the division
// 'famcart-last-user' makes in lib/session for the same reason.
