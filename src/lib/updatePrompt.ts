// in a place that is nobody's fault and needs a different sentence: Android has
// not been told FamCart may install packages, and that consent lives on a
// settings screen rather than in a dialog we can raise. Treating that as an
// error would tell the user something is broken when the truth is that one
// switch is off, so it gets its own phase and its own button.
//
// Same shape as lib/firstRunGreeting: this owns the state, the view renders it.

// How Settings reaches the check without four layers of props between them.
// HomeView owns the prompt; the row that runs it lives in AppSettingsModal,
// which is two components down inside AppTopbar. Provided rather than passed,
// because nothing in between has any business knowing about app updates.
