// Reading a barcode and deciding what it means.
//
// A scan is a suggestion arrived at with the camera instead of the keyboard, so
// a hit takes the tapped-suggestion path exactly and lands the same
// confirmation. Only the miss is new, and it is handed to the "add your own"
// dialog that already exists for the typed version of the same problem.
//
// Two ways to obtain the code, one way to act on it. In the app that is Google's
// scanner: auto-zoom, and no camera permission of our own (see
// lib/barcodeScanner). In a browser, where that does not exist, it is our own
// camera screen. Everything from the code onwards — resolveScannedCode below —
// is shared, so the two differ only in how the barcode is read.
//
// Extracted from HomeView, where it was one of the last concerns still inline.
// The naming dialog deliberately stays with the view: it serves the typed
// "Can't find it?" path as well, so it belongs to neither half on its own. This
// reports a miss through onUnknownCode and lets the view decide what to open.
