// charge — lives in the virtual:pwa-register module, which this app never
// imports. So a deploy would install in the background, take over immediately
// via skipWaiting/clientsClaim (src/sw.js), and then just sit there: the page on
// screen was already painted from the previous precache, and src/sw.js answers
// navigations out of that precache too, so every ordinary refresh kept serving
// the old build until a cache-bypassing reload. Hence injectRegister: null in
// vite.config.js and this module doing the registering.
