// Looking a string up in the language the app is currently in.
//
// Hand-rolled rather than vue-i18n, and the deciding argument was the test
// suite. Around forty test files mount a component with a bare
// `mount(Component, …)` and no `global.plugins` — appSettingsModal's helper is
// the typical shape — and vue-i18n's `$t` only exists after `app.use(i18n)`.
// Adopting it would mean editing every one of those files and remembering to
// wire the plugin into every future one. A plain exported `t()` imported in
// `<script setup>` is auto-exposed to the template by the SFC compiler and
// needs no app context at all, so the suite kept passing untouched.
//
// The same property is why `t()` works in plain .ts — shoppingListActions,
// purchaseHistory, the router guard — with no useI18n()/setup-context rule to
// remember. That is the shape setSupabaseTokenResolver already uses in
// supabase.ts: module-scope state installed once at boot, read from anywhere.
//
// Romanian is the other half of the argument. It has three cardinal plural
// categories where English has two, and Intl.PluralRules knows them natively,
// whereas vue-i18n's default pluralization is positional and would need a
// custom rule per language — the part we would have had to replace anyway.
//
// ── THE ONE TRAP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A `t()` call at MODULE SCOPE runs once at import and never updates:
//
//     const OFFLINE_MESSAGE = t('error.offline')   // WRONG — frozen forever
//
// It has to be inside a function, a computed, or the template. Reactivity here
// comes from `t()` reading `messages.value` during render, which subscribes
// whatever is rendering; a value captured into a module const was never
// rendering. Grep a file for top-level string constants before translating it.
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TRANSLATED ───────────────────────────────────
// Written down because a later "finish the i18n pass" sweep will otherwise
// treat each of these as an oversight:
//
//   • Product names and makers. Catalog data, largely Romanian, and not ours
//     to restate: they arrive already normalised by whatever fills the
//     catalog.
//   • Household names, member display names, invite codes. User data.
//   • nativeOAuth.ts's thrown Error text. It is a plain Error, so userMessage
//     replaces it before it can reach a screen; its whole value is being a
//     greppable string in Sentry.
//   • errorReporting.ts breadcrumbs and tags, issueReport.ts payload fields.
//     Read by us, not by users, and worth less once they vary by language.
//   • android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml. Two brand names and two
//     identifiers, one of which is the famcart:// scheme Clerk's OAuth return
//     leg matches — see CLAUDE.md.
//   • index.html's <meta name="description">. Static markup served before any
//     of this has run, for the same reason vite.config.js pins the manifest to
//     lang: 'en': localising it means shipping six copies and swapping them at
//     runtime, which is not what a description tag is worth.
//   • MEMBER_FALLBACK_NAME in userIdentity.ts. It looks like display copy and
//     is not: the same string is the profiles column default and what
//     buy_items() and join_household_with_code() write in 003/005, so it has
//     to read the same to every member's device. memberDisplayName() beside it
//     IS translated, and the comment there marks exactly where the two part.
//   • The localeCompare(…, 'en') pins in productSuggestions, productRecents,
//     purchaseHistory and HomeView. Sorting by the reader's language would
//     order one household's list differently on two phones; the pin is what
//     makes "same order everywhere" true. They are tie-breakers over catalog
//     data, so no translated word is involved either way.
