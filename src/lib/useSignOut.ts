// Everything that has to happen when somebody signs out, in the order it has to
// happen in.
//
// This lived in AppNavBar, which is a navigation shell that also happens to
// host six dialogs — so the one piece of it that is not about drawing anything
// was the hardest to find and the only part that could not be tested without
// mounting the whole bar. Four subsystems are torn down here and each of them
// has a reason to be at the position it is:
//
//   • Local state first, because it is the only step that cannot fail and the
//     only one whose failure would be silent. lib/session owns the list of what
//     that means, which is why this calls one function rather than four.
//   • Sentry's identity next. setUser is sticky module state rather than
//     per-event, so anything raised after this point would otherwise still be
//     filed under the person who just left.
//   • OneSignal, unawaited. A device left bound is the next person on this
//     phone inheriting the previous account's notifications, and it must not be
//     able to hold the sign-out up on a CDN.
//   • Clerk last, because it is the step that navigates away and nothing after
//     it is guaranteed to run.
//
// The catch matters more than it looks: by the time Clerk is asked, the session
// is already over locally, so a failure there is worth reporting and not worth
// a dialog on the way out.
