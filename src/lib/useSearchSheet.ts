// The add search as a bottom sheet.
//
// On a phone the suggestions dropdown has nowhere to go, so the search is the
// whole viewport instead: a sheet that rises from the bottom edge, with the
// field in a header band at the top of it and the matches running edge to edge
// beneath, down to wherever the keyboard starts.
//
// It used to be a FLIP. The field lived inline above the list, and focusing it
// froze the slot's height, translated the field's row back to where it had just
// been and let the browser animate the release, so that the one thing the user
// had touched was the one thing that did not blink out and reappear somewhere
// else. That was the right answer for a field with a place in the flow.
//
// The field no longer has one. The list screen's shell is a bottom bar now and
// adding starts from its centre button, so there is no origin to fly from and
// the measurement, the inversion and the transitionend plumbing all had nothing
// left to measure. What replaced them is the motion the app already owns for
// anything anchored to the bottom edge (--modal-rise: 100% with the shared
// modal-rise keyframes in style.css), which is also the edge the keyboard is
// about to come from.
//
// What survives is the part that was always the hard bit: knowing where the
// visual viewport actually is. Android resizes the WebView and leaves offsetTop
// at 0; iOS does not resize and puts the difference in offsetTop. Both are
// wrong in different ways if you reach for window.innerHeight.

// The width at which the bar hands over to the header shell, matching the 900px
// boundary in AppNavBar and --desktop-column. Above it the form stays in the
// flow as an ordinary field with a dropdown, and none of this applies.
//
// This was 599.98px when the split was "does the dropdown fit", which is a
// different question from "which shell is this". One breakpoint answering both
// is what would have left a 600-899px window with a bar it could not open.
