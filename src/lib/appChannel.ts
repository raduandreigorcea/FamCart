// the `famcart` Supabase project, and the nightly one, wired to `famcart-dev`.
// Until this module existed the two were pixel-identical, so a screenshot, a
// bug report or a phone left on a desk could not tell you which database it
// had been talking to. Worse, the failure was silent in the dangerous
// direction: a production build accidentally pointing at dev looked exactly
// like the real thing.
//
// So the channel is derived from what the build is actually connected to
// rather than declared, and it is safe by default in both directions. Only the
// exact production project ref, or an explicit `production` override, produces
// an unmarked build. Everything else wears the badge.
