// for a round trip to a SECOND database before it could say where anything came
// from.

// So the answer is cached the same way the list is. On a warm start the badges
// paint with the rows, and the fetch below still runs and replaces them, which
// is what keeps a shop that dropped a product from showing forever.
//
// Nothing here is private: it is which shops sell a product, which every signed
// in user can read anyway. It is keyed by version alone rather than by user, and
// a household's product NAMES are the only thing about it that came from them --
// the same names already sitting in the snapshot cache next to it.

// cache is also DROPPED when its account signs out, and for a while this was
// not, so the names outlived the session on a shared device.
