// The design premise, which is why this file exists at all rather than the
// dialog just holding a string: a report is only worth sending if someone can
// act on it, and almost everything that makes it actionable is something the
// app already knows. Version, connection, platform, whether there is stuck
// offline work — asking a person shopping in a supermarket to type any of that
// is asking them to do the app's job. So the dialog collects the two things
// only they can answer (where, and what happened) and this assembles the rest.
//
// The places below are named the way someone using FamCart would name them, not
// the way the code is organised: "Adding items", not AddItemForm. A report that
// says "Barcode scanner" narrows the search to two files without the reporter
// knowing either of them exists.
