// @sentry/vue is ~218 KB — about a third of the app's JavaScript — and it was
// imported at module scope in main.ts, so every cold start paid for it before
// the first item could be rendered. On a grocery list opened on a phone in a
// shop, that is the wrong thing to spend a connection on.
//
// So the SDK is loaded after the app is up and idle, and everything that wants
// to report an error talks to this module instead of importing Sentry directly.
// Reports raised before it lands are buffered and flushed on arrival.
//
// The cost, stated plainly: the initial pageload transaction is no longer
// traced, because tracing has to be installed before the load it measures. At a
// 10% trace sample rate that is a small loss against a third of the bundle, but
// it is a loss rather than a free win.
