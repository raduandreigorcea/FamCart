// The deep link an OAuth sign-in comes back through, and which app it reaches.
//
// Two builds are installed side by side (com.famcart.app and
// com.famcart.app.nightly), and a custom URL scheme is claimed per app, not per
// install. If both claimed famcart://, Android would stop the sign-in halfway
// through to ask which FamCart should receive it, and picking wrong drops you
// into the other app's session. So the schemes differ.
//
// The awkward part is the middle of the round trip. Clerk refuses a custom
// scheme as a redirect target for a web-mode client, so the browser is sent to
// /sso-native on the deployed site, and that page forwards to the deep link.
// That page is served by the PRODUCTION deployment whichever app started the
// flow, so it cannot read its own channel to decide where to hand back. The
// app therefore marks the bounce URL on the way out, and the page reads the
// mark on the way back. Anything unmarked belongs to production, which is both
// the old behaviour and the safe guess.
//
// Keep in sync with the ${ssoScheme} manifest placeholder in
// android/app/build.gradle, which is where each flavour declares what it
// answers to.
