// the last one still on it.
//
// Milder than either of those, and worth saying why it is fixed the same way
// anyway: a snapshot is only a cache, so losing one costs a slower boot rather
// than a user's unsent writes or a consent nobody gave. It is the same shape of
// problem one severity down, and leaving the shape in place is how it survives
// to reappear somewhere it does matter — which is why the keying itself now

// (lib/productSuggestions) interpolates it into a PostgREST `or` filter, whose
// syntax is comma- and dot-separated. The comment there is right that the id is
// server-issued — but only on the live path. Restored from a snapshot it is
// whatever localStorage happened to hold, and localStorage is not a trust
// boundary the app controls.
//
// RLS is still what decides which rows anyone may see, so this is not the thing
// standing between a tampered cache and another list. It is the
// cheap check that keeps a value that was never an id from being spliced into a
// filter expression at all.
//
// Deliberately "an opaque identifier" rather than "a uuid", though in
// production it is always the latter. What has to be excluded is PostgREST's
// filter syntax — the comma that separates conditions, the dot that separates
// column from operator, parens, colons, quotes, whitespace — and an allowlist
// of identifier characters excludes all of it. Demanding the full uuid shape
// would additionally assert a storage format this module has no reason to
// care about, and would break on any future id scheme without being any safer
// against the thing it is actually guarding.
