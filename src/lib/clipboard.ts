// There were three of these. lib/inviteShare had one as the desktop fallback for
// the share sheet; OverviewPanel and OnboardingTour each had their own, with the
// same swallowed failure, the same "Copied" flag, two different hold durations
// (2000ms and 1800ms), and only one of the two clearing its timer. The tour's
// also stacked: tapping twice queued overlapping timers that fought over one
// boolean, so the second tap's confirmation could be cancelled by the first
// tap's expiry.
//
// Same argument as lib/inviteCode, which exists because the code generator was
// duplicated across two views: one behaviour written twice is one that gets
// fixed once.
