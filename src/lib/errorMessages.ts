// What a failure is allowed to say out loud.
//
// Supabase hands back Postgres error text verbatim: constraint names, trigger
// messages, "permission denied for table shopping_list_items". Passing that
// straight into the UI (the old `error.message ?? 'Could not …'` fallback) turned
// every failure into a readout of the schema. It also read badly — nobody wants
// "duplicate key value violates unique constraint" in a dialog.
//
// So messages come from one of two places:
//   • UserFacingError — text written deliberately for the user, shown as-is;
//   • everything else — replaced with the caller's fallback, with the original
//     sent to Sentry so the detail is still there when debugging.
//
// Errors are still *inspected* freely at the call sites (the item-limit and
// 23505 branches read error.message/code to pick a friendly response). This is
// only about what reaches the screen.

export class UserFacingError extends Error {

// Reporting is a no-op without a DSN (dev, CI, tests) and buffers until the SDK
// finishes loading, so this is safe everywhere and at any time. Wrapped anyway:
// reporting must never throw on top of the failure it is reporting.

// reach the UI. Deliberate messages pass through; anything else is reported and
