// Lint rules, added because the discipline they encode was previously held by
// hand alone. That worked — the audit that prompted this found no console.log,
// no TODO, no `any` and no @ts-ignore anywhere in src — but "one person keeps
// noticing" is not the same guarantee as "the build refuses", and the second one
// is the point of writing it down.
//
// Deliberately narrow. vue-tsc already owns types, props, emits and template
// expressions (npm run typecheck), and tsconfig already has noUnusedLocals and
// noUnusedParameters, so anything here that re-checks those is duplicated work
// with two places to disagree. What is left is the set vue-tsc structurally
// cannot see: template-shaped mistakes, and the debugging leftovers that are
// perfectly valid TypeScript.
//
// No formatting rules and no Prettier. Nothing in this repo is misformatted, the
// diffs a formatter would produce on first run would bury the history of every
// file it touched, and a reformat is not a thing to hide inside a lint config.
