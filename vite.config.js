// running and reachable while the browser never sees a line of it: the page it
// serves is built HTML with no /@vite/client in it, so there is no HMR socket
// either. Phones are where this bites, because clearing site data on one is
// buried three menus deep.
//
// The worker cannot fix itself. It re-fetches /sw.js to check for a new version,
// and in dev that path is the SPA fallback — HTML where a script belongs, so the
// update fails and the old worker stays. Serving a real script here is what
// breaks the loop: the browser accepts it, and it removes itself and its caches
// on activation, then reloads whatever tabs it was holding.
