/**
 * Installing a new FamCart APK from inside the old one.
 *
 * FamCart ships as a downloadable APK rather than through a store, so nothing
 * updates it on the user's behalf. The web layer finds out that a newer release
 * exists (see src/lib/nativeUpdate.ts); this is the half that can actually act
 * on it, because fetching a file to disk and asking Android to install it are
 * both outside what a WebView is allowed to do.
 *
 * Three things here are not obvious:
 *
 *   • The download is native, not fetch(). A WebView download would have to
 *     survive CORS on GitHub's asset redirect and then hand ~30 MB across the
 *     bridge as base64 to be written out. Reading it straight to cacheDir avoids
 *     both, and gives real byte counts to show a progress bar with.
 *
 *   • Redirects are followed by hand. GitHub answers the release-asset URL with
 *     a 302 to objects.githubusercontent.com, and HttpURLConnection's automatic
 *     following is not dependable across a host change — a silently unfollowed
 *     redirect writes a few hundred bytes of HTML into a file named .apk, which
 *     then fails at the installer with nothing explaining why.
 *
 *   • The file goes to the cache directory, which is what the FileProvider in
 *     AndroidManifest.xml is already configured to share (res/xml/file_paths).
 *     A plain file:// Uri has been illegal to hand another app since Android 7,
 *     and the installer is another app.
