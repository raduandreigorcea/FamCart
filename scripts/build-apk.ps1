# Builds the NIGHTLY Android APK: web build -> capacitor sync -> gradle.
# Run via `npm run build:apk`.
#
# WHY THIS COMMAND ONLY EVER BUILDS NIGHTLY
#
# Production APKs come from .github/workflows/release-apk.yml and nowhere else.
# That workflow is the only place holding the production secrets, checks that
# the version moved, and signs with the key every installed FamCart was signed
# with. A laptop that can also produce a production APK is a second, unchecked
# route to the thing people install -- and the mistake it invites is silent: an
# APK that looks right, is signed right, and quietly carries whatever was in
# this machine's env files.
#
# So this builds the second app instead: FamCart Nightly, application id
# com.famcart.app.nightly, pointed at famcart-dev. It installs BESIDE the real
# app rather than over it, so the phone you shop with keeps working while you
# test on the same device.

# THE DEV CREDENTIALS COME FROM THE FILE `npm run dev` ALREADY USES
#
# .env.development.local is only read by Vite in development mode, and this is a

# that same file rather than introducing a .env.nightly is deliberate: two files
# holding the same credentials drift, and the one that drifts is always the one
# nobody opens.
#
# Vite gives a VITE_ variable found in the environment precedence over every
# .env file (see loadEnv), which is what lets these win over the production
# values sitting in .env without that file being touched.
